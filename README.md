Proxy Grabber is a practical tool that simplifies the process of gathering proxy server information. It's an open-source project that works by scraping data from a given website using wget and fetching data to keep only the free trial proxy servers provided by those websites. It then compiles these proxies into one list for your convenience.

## Problem

Finding free and reliable proxy servers can be a challenging task, requiring manual searching and verification. It can be frustrating and time-consuming.

### Agitate

Imagine spending hours searching for free proxy servers, only to end up with unreliable ones. It's a never-ending cycle of disappointment and wasted time.

## Solution

But what if there was a way to simplify the process and ensure you always have access to the best proxies?

## Future

With Proxy Grabber, you can say goodbye to the hassle of manual searching.

1. Install `wget` command on your machine.

## Performance
